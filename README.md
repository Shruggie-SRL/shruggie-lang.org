` ¯\_(ツ)_/¯-lang `

Every function begins and ends with `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
Every line ends with `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

## Control flow:

If' s: `if ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ {}`

Ternaries: `¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

Switch's, DEFAULT tag: `¯\_(ツ)_/¯:`

## Loops:

```
Do {
} Until ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
```

```
While ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
{
 //Do...what you have to do or ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
}
```

## Lambdas: 

```
(¯\_(ツ)_/¯)=>{}()
```

## Shruggie object notation AKA. Shrugon or `¯\_(ツ)_/¯on`

```
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
"key": "value" //(defaults to ¯\_(ツ)_/¯, no nulls or nils)
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
```

## Pointers

`*¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

Of course! and obviously: `**¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

## Multidimentional Arrays

`[ ¯\_(ツ)_/¯, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ]`

``¯\_(ツ)_/¯ myArray = [¯\_(ツ)_/¯,¯\_(ツ)_/¯] ¯\_(ツ)_/¯``

and by the way `¯\_(ツ)_/¯` is immutable

## Is ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ a strongly typed language?
 
`¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

## Overloading

`¯\_(ツ)_/¯.¯\_(ツ)_/¯ = ¯\_(ツ)_/¯() => {}`

## Lazy Evalutions

`(¯\_(ツ)_/¯).¯\_(ツ)_/¯(¯\_(ツ)_/¯)¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

## Is Turing complete?: 

`¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
